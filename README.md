  ## Description:
  ### Deployed: https://the-mvc-techblog.herokuapp.com/ <br /><br /> 
  The motivation behind this project was to build a CMS-style blog where developers can create blog posts and comment on other developers' posts. This application uses Handlebars.js, Sequelize, and express-session npm for authentication. <br /><br />  For future development of this project, I would like to add the ablity for a user to edit their username and email.
